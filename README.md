 Introduction
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Devin, @Snooty143
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about software development. I want to build a career with code and development, I find it very enjoyable and fun. My long term goals are to move into game development and work to make games!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a little bit of everything. I haven't settled on my favorite language yet and I have been picking up different coding concepts and learning techniques from many different places. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: A common theory about coconuts is that they migrated to the Carribean by floating across the ocean.
